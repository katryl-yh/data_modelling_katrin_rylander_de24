## 0. Ezecream orders

Our beloved ice cream company Ezecream has a Sales table that looks like this

| order_id | order_date | customer_id | customer_name  | customer_address | product_id | product_name | quantity |
| -------- | ---------- | ----------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ---------- | ------------ | -------- |
| 101      | 2024-04-05 | 05          | Ragnar Lodbrok | Kattegatt 3      | 3          | Bl√•b√§rsmagi  | 20       |
| 101      | 2024-04-05 | 05          | Ragnar Lodbrok | Kattegatt 3      | 5          | Lakritsdr√∂m  | 15       |

a) Find different problems with this table, so that Ezecream will take you in for internship to fix it for them.

**ANSWER**
We could identify the following problems:

1. data redundancy

- Definition: same values repeated across multiple rows which leads to problems with data consistency and increased storage usage.
  Example: look order 101: name + address repeated 3 times.

2. insertion anomaly

- Definition: An insertion anomaly occurs when adding a new record is impossible or requires unnecessary data (depends on the constraints in the database).
- Example:A new customer cannot be added unless they have placed an order.

3. update anomaly

- Definition: updating/modifying a value in one row leads to inconsistencies with other rows. In other words one would have to update same info in several places.
- Example: If we need update name/address of a customer that is present in several rows, we would have to manually update it in each row linked to this customer or create inconsistent data.

4. deletion anomaly

- Definition: deletion of a record leads to unintentional loss of data. In other words: you remove data you wanted to remove PLUS data that you should have kept.
- Example: If a product is only stored in the Sales table and we delete the last order for that product, we lose all knowledge of that product.

b1) Does this table satisfy 1NF, 2NF? Motivate.

**ANSWER**

**checklist 1NF**
‚úÖ row order doesn't matter
‚úÖ Primary Key (PK) exists in each table
NOTE: We assume a composite key (order_id, product_id).
However, this prevents the same customer from adding the same product to an order with a different quantity.
‚úÖ No repeting groups  
‚úÖ Unifor column data (atomic values, one data type per attribute)

The table satisfies 1NF: all attributes are atomic and uniquely identified by the PK.

**checklist 2NF**
‚úÖ 1NF is satisfied
üî¥ Non prime attributes must be functionally dependent on entire PK,not just part of it:

- Problem: customer_name and customer_address depend only on customer_id,
  not on the full composite key (order_id, product_id).
- Conclusion: This means partial dependency exists, so the table violates 2NF and needs normalization.

**How to check the last step:**

- Identify the Primary Key (PK): (order_id, product_id).
- Identify non-key columns (columns not in the PK).
- Check if each non-key column fully depends on the entire PK.
- If any column depends only on part of the PK, then ‚ùå 2NF is not satisfied.

b2) Normalize this table to 3NF, make conceptual diagram and relational schema notation for each relation. Relational schema notation is `RelationName(attribute1, attribute2, ...)`

**ANSWER**
We should divide the Sales table into the following entities:

**Customer**

- customer_id (PK)
- customer_name
- customer_address

**Order**

- order_id (PK)
- order_date
- customer_id (FK ‚Üí Customer)

**Product**

- product_id (PK)
- product_name

**Order_Detail**

- Composite primary key (order_id, product_id), (PK)
- order_id (PK, FK ‚Üí Order)
- product_id (PK, FK ‚Üí Product)
- quantity

**conceptual ERD**

<img src = "../assets/ex2_0_ezecream_ERD.png">

**_Relationel schema notation_**

- Customer(customer_id, customer_name, customer_address)
- Product(product_id, product_name)
- Order(order_id, order_date, customer_id)
- Order_Detail(order_id, product_id, quantity)
  (PK: (order_id, product_id), FK: order_id ‚Üí Order, product_id ‚Üí Product)

c) Now also add price attribute. Think about what would happen when price increases or decreases.
**ANSWER**

The outcome is different, depending where we add the price attribute.
Possible solutions are:

- A: Store price in the Product table.
  Works well if prices never change.
  Problem: If prices increase or decrease, historical orders would be incorrect because they would always show the latest price instead of the original purchase price.

- B: Store price in Order_Detail.
  Best if prices change over time, as it ensures that each order keeps the price valid at the time of purchase.
  Works well for: Tracking historical sales correctly.

- C: Create a separate Price_List entity.
  Why? If you need to keep track of historical price changes separately, you can store price updates in a dedicated table.
  Implementation:
- Price_List(product_id (PK, FK ‚Üí Product), price, update_date (PK))
  Stores all historical prices.
- Order_Detail(order_id, product_id, quantity, price) (stores price at purchase time)
  Advantage: This structure allows both tracking old orders correctly and keeping a history of past prices.

### NOTE:

- price in Price_List = Historical price of a product on a certain date

  | product_id | price | update_date |
  | ---------- | ----- | ----------- |
  | 3          | 10.00 | 2024-01-01  |
  | 3          | 12.50 | 2024-06-01  |
  | 5          | 8.00  | 2024-03-15  |

- price in Order_Detail = Final price at the time of purchase

  | order_id | product_id | price | quantity |
  | -------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
  | 101      | 3          | 10.00 | 1        |
  | 102      | 3          | 12.50 | 2        |
  | 103      | 5          | 8.00  | 4        |

d) Write SQL code to get the total price for Ragnar Lodbrok.
Insert data into your tables and test it out.
