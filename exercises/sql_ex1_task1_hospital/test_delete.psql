-- NOTE: when I tried to run the query I got an ERROR
-- ERROR: update or delete on table "doctor" 
-- violates foreign key constraint 
-- "departmentdoctor_doctor_id_fkey" on table "departmentdoctor"
DELETE FROM hospital_ex1.doctor  WHERE name = 'Dr. Abra Abrahamson';

-- FOLLOWING fix proposed by chatgtp
-- 1. Drop Existing Constraints
ALTER TABLE hospital_ex1.HospitalDepartment 
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS hospitaldepartment_hospital_id_fkey,
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS hospitaldepartment_department_id_fkey;

ALTER TABLE hospital_ex1.DepartmentDoctor 
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS departmentdoctor_department_id_fkey,
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS departmentdoctor_doctor_id_fkey;

ALTER TABLE hospital_ex1.HospitalDoctor 
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS hospitaldoctor_hospital_id_fkey,
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS hospitaldoctor_doctor_id_fkey;

-- 2. Recreate Foreign Keys with ON DELETE CASCADE
ALTER TABLE hospital_ex1.HospitalDepartment 
ADD CONSTRAINT hospitaldepartment_hospital_id_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (hospital_id) REFERENCES hospital_ex1.hospital (hospital_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
ADD CONSTRAINT hospitaldepartment_department_id_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES hospital_ex1.department (department_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

ALTER TABLE hospital_ex1.DepartmentDoctor 
ADD CONSTRAINT departmentdoctor_department_id_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES hospital_ex1.department (department_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
ADD CONSTRAINT departmentdoctor_doctor_id_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (doctor_id) REFERENCES hospital_ex1.doctor (doctor_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

ALTER TABLE hospital_ex1.HospitalDoctor 
ADD CONSTRAINT hospitaldoctor_hospital_id_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (hospital_id) REFERENCES hospital_ex1.hospital (hospital_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
ADD CONSTRAINT hospitaldoctor_doctor_id_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (doctor_id) REFERENCES hospital_ex1.doctor (doctor_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- 3. Verify the Foreign Keys
SELECT conrelid::regclass AS table_name, confrelid::regclass AS referenced_table, conname AS constraint_name
FROM pg_constraint
WHERE confrelid = 'hospital_ex1.doctor'::regclass;

-- 4. Test Doctor Deletion
DELETE FROM hospital_ex1.Doctor WHERE doctor_id = 1;

-- SELECT * FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'hospital_ex1';
